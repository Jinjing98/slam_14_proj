# slam_14_proj

I took a slam course (14 Lectures on Visual SLAM) from Xiang Gao. I read through the book and followed this author to recode from scratch what he has achieved in this repo "https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook", which includes basic visual odometry(for Mono cam mostly), loop closure and optimization etc.

The visual odometry part is under the directory "project", 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 are four different versions of the VO.

All of the code is programmed on KDEVELOP.
